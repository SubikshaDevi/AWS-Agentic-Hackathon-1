While the tech world obsesses over digital interactions, most of our economy still runs on millions of in-person sales and service conversations happening daily across the U.S. Unlike Zoom calls, these conversations weren't historically recorded – leaving petabytes of rich data untapped. Until now. Companies in hundreds of industries rely on frontline salesforces working in-person, yet they've operated with zero visibility into these critical customer interactions. Meanwhile, sales productivity follows a stark Pareto distribution – the vast majority of commissions accumulate to a small percentage of top performers, leaving millions of salespeople struggling to achieve financial freedom. With Siro, we're democratizing sales excellence. Our customers see their reps closing up to 40% more deals, all while gaining unprecedented insights from field conversations. We've built an intelligence platform that captures, processes, and derives actionable insights from in-person sales and service conversations. Our customers span diverse industries – home improvement, home services (HVAC, plumbing), retail, B2B distribution, insurance, hospitality, and more. With over $75M in backing from world-class investors, we're on a mission to make field sales the most accessible path to financial freedom.
