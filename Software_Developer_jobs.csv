We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key. What You'll Achieve Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience. Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.

A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease-of-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve. Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges. Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Nice To Haves Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase. An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

4315524803,Software Engineer,Candid Health,"What we do We’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing. Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software. We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively. We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today! Our values We Spend At Least As Much Time With Our Coworkers As We Do With Our Closest Friends + Family - If We Intend To Do The Most Important + Challenging Work Of Our Lives, It’s Important That These Folks Energize Us, Support Us, Inspire Us, And Push Us To Do Our Best Work. This Is What You Can Expect Of Your Teammates At Candid (in No Particular Order) We put our customers first We take care of each other and ourselves We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace We believe humility is our greatest strength We are candid, kind, and committed We strive to be the most prepared person in the room We are truth seekers What you’ll be doing You’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over large swaths of our product + infrastructure. You’ll interact closely with our current + prospective customers, developing intuition around their biggest pain points and thinking of creative ways to address them. You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering + broader company culture and help make this the best place we’ve ever worked. Who you are You have Bachelors of Science or Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree. Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus, but by no means required: Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, React, Typescript, Google Cloud Platform, Auth0, Terraform. You enjoy building high-quality software, but you also anchor on outcomes and have good intuition around which corners are worth cutting and which aren’t. You enjoy owning features end-to-end and are comfortable learning new tools or moving across the stack to do so. You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value teaching others. You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing. Pay Transparency The estimated starting annual salary range for this position is $135,000 to $200,000 USD. The listed range is a guideline from Pave data, and the actual base salary may be modified based on factors including job-related skills, experience/qualifications, interview performance, market data, etc. Total compensation for this position may also include equity, sales incentives (for sales roles), and employee benefits. Given Candid Health’s funding and size, we heavily value the potential upside from equity in our compensation package. Further note that Candid Health has minimal hierarchy and titles, but has broad ranges of experience represented within roles. We are an equal opportunity employer. We don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We also consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law, including but not limited to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4315524803,2025-10-21 15:00:27
